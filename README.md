# About the Project

This is a back-end project to create a server for the WTWR application. This connects the WTWR application to a database as that different users can access their profiles and clothing item cards. Users are able to be added to the database, and can see, add, like, dislike, and remove their clothing item cards.

# Technologies Used

Javascript was used to create the routes and controllers for adding information to the database. Mongoose and MongoDB were used to connect the JavaScript files to the database.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
