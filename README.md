# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

# About the Project

This is a back-end project to create a server for the WTWR application. This connects the WTWR application to a database as that different users can access their profiles and clothing item cards. Users are able to be added to the database, and can see, add, like, dislike, and remove their clothing item cards.

# Technologies Used

Javascript was used to create the routes and controllers for adding information to the database. Mongoose and MongoDB were used to connect the JavaScript files to the database.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
